# Modelling-tetani-for-PLFFD
This repository includes to code used to model tetani from a limited number of pulses in the article "Maximal results with minimal stimuli: the fewest high-frequency pulses needed to measure or model prolonged low-frequency force depression in the dorsiflexors"
The file example_session has experimental torques from one participant from one experimental session.
All files should be in the same folder when running the simulation.
To start the simulation run in MATLAB the script fitting_auto. All the other script files will be called automatically. When requested, input the value of tau_c highglighted with a red dot in the MATLAB Command Window.
The 6 variables for each pair of 10 and 100 Hz considered with 4,7,12,25,50, and 100 pulses, will be output in an excel file named copy_values.
